##2.2 Data Cleansing & Coertions
check data type for each colomn
```{r}
str(loan_kiva)

```
for this result , we find some of data type not in the correct type, we need to convert it into corect type (data coertion)

```{r}
loan_kiva[,c("activity","sector","country","region","currency","repayment_interval")] =lapply(loan_kiva[,c("activity","sector","country","region","currency","repayment_interval")],as.factor)

loan_kiva$posted_time <- as.Date(loan_kiva$posted_time,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
loan_kiva$funded_time <- as.Date(loan_kiva$funded_time,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")


str(loan_kiva)
```

Each of colomn already changed ito desired data type

cek for missing value
```{r}
colSums(is.na(loan_kiva))
```
```{r}
anyNA(loan_kiva)
```

Great! No missing value
